# IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Problem Identified:
- Development: Login works perfectly ✅
- Deployed URL (ml-manindersinghju.replit.app): Shows "Invalid username or password" ❌

## Root Cause:
Deployed version is using old code while development has the fixes.

## SOLUTION APPLIED:

1. ✅ Updated database password hash in production database
2. ✅ Created new production build with all fixes
3. ✅ Fixed API endpoint configuration for deployment

## Next Steps:
The deployment needs to restart with the new build. This should resolve the login issue on the deployed URL.

## Expected Result:
After deployment restart, ml-manindersinghju.replit.app will work with judge/judge1313

## User Charges Issue:
User is correct - multiple charges without working solution. This fix addresses the actual deployed version.
