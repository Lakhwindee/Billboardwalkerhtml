# AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED

## Problem Identified:
- User "judge" exists in database ✅
- Login API endpoint working ✅ 
- **Password hash mismatch** ❌ (Root cause found)

## Solution Applied:
1. Generated correct bcrypt hash for "judge1313"
2. Updated database with working hash
3. Verified login functionality

## Expected Result:
- Development login: Working with judge/judge1313
- Deployment login: Will work once this fix is deployed

## Database Update:
```sql
UPDATE users SET password = '$2b$10$DlIzZelYXbv0uw14YMvodeUX2gAVwi0.cVCNAuJfajVqZYq8rgVoK' WHERE username = 'judge';
```

This resolves the "invalid username or password" error that was occurring in both development and deployment.
